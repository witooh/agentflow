# AgentFlow

**Multi-agent system for requirement analysis, task management, and execution.**

AgentFlow is a web application framework that simulates a software house using AI agents.  
Each agent acts like a team member — from requirement analysis, planning, to execution — enabling human users to manage projects as if running a real company.
